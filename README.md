# quantum-mystique
Welcome to Quantum Mystique, an early stage exploration of the possibility and advantages of quantum computing over classical!

Using Rigetti's Quantum Virtual Machine ("QVM") and some of their actual real-life quantum devices (wow!), we will be
implementing and designing quantum algorithms with the hope of understanding and--hopefully--improving existing algorithms.
